I was looking at <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> this morning and came across <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9142806/Court_orders_three_H_1B_sites_disabled">this</a>, a post about some court order to shut down some anti H1-B websites.  I thought, "What is H1-B?" <p />The <b>H-1B</b> is a non-immigrant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_visas" title="United States visas">visa in the United States</a> under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act" title="Immigration and Nationality Act">Immigration and Nationality Act</a>, section 101(a)(15)(H). It allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. If a foreign worker in H-1B status quits or is dismissed from the sponsoring employer, the worker can find another employer, apply for a change of status to another non-immigrant status, or must leave the US. -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa">according to Wikipedia </a><p />Well, a non-immigrant worker.  OK...  I looked at the list of websites and found <a href="http://guestworkerfraud.com/">this one</a>, http://guestworkerfraud.com/, was not shut down.  So I went over and read some articles.  Now I am looking around and finding that it is a little non-pc.  That must be why it has been ordered to be shut down. <p />One of the <a href="http://guestworkerfraud.com/government/#001021">articles</a>  I read and will quote here in case the site gets shut down,<p />More proof that it is America's corporate &amp; government elite who are jealous of America's engineering class. Can't have engineers having more prestige than financial types - <i>even though America's engineers created the 90s boom and the financial elite wrecked Wall St. &amp; the U.S. economy.</i><br /><a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/jeff_ge_joyride_Z3frhCTVy6YtMT3dmmpAPM"><br />http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/jeff_ge_joyride_Z3frhCTVy6YtMT3dmmpAPM</a><p />The comments at West Point -- which were received positively by those in attendance and across the corporate world -- <b>reiterated his view that financial-services skills are today more valued than engineering, technical or scientific knowhow.<p /></b>seemed to hit the nail on the head for me.  It seems that the United States has become all about making money at all costs.  Wall Street gets paid insane amounts of money for outsourcing jobs to increase the supposed earnings while the unemployment rate hits an all time high?  It just doesn't make sense to me. <p />I thought the United States was suppose to be a melting pot of races, cultures, and peoples all coming together for a greater good, to be one people for one country.  I guess my ideal United States is not a good global view.  I would have us be self sufficient, relying on no other country or power.  Making and consuming all our own goods and services.  Producing an economy that cannot be intimidated and sabotaged by other countries.  A country that cannot be bought with foreign oil, or foreign factories.  A place of hard working individuals with a pride in each others work and satisfaction in their own. <p />A country like that would be a wild-card for the world.  Most undesirable indeed!  :)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7696555460565635585-6585668673200891129?l=www.jet5ive.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /></div>
