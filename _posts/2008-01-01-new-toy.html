My wife and I got an Archos 605 wifi this Christmas.  It is great.  I can put movies, music, photos and files on it.  It has a 30gd hard drive in it, though you can get it in 4gb, 80gb and 160gb.  With some optional plugins it will do H.264 and AAC, as well as mpeg2.  It can even surf the web with an opera web browser.  Opera also means widgets... There are several for this device, though you can put just about any on it, however, it is still a handheld device.  If you are expecting the performance of a laptop, buy a laptop.  It has a tendency to crash when something happens that it doesn't know how to handle, but it reboots quickly enough.   Overall, I like the thing.<img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7696555460565635585-3870309243667519144?l=www.jet5ive.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" />
