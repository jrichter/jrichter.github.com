We, as a people, elected a new President this week.  President Elect Barack Obama, will be the 44th President of these United States.  This next term should be interesting.  So I won't forget, he campaigned on the economy, energy, health care, and education.  If I am forgetting anything major please leave it in the comments.<img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7696555460565635585-862693777608129727?l=www.jet5ive.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" />
