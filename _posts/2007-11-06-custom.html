Sweet.  I was looking through Google's new options for blogger today.  I found out that now I can use my own domain name without an ftp and still have a blog.  It is so cool!  I love it.  I also joined <a href="http://www.GrandCentral.com">GrandCentral.com</a> today.  It is a cool phone site.  It allows you to have one number that filters your calls, stores your contacts, gives you custom greetings for differents groups, and rings all your phones at once.  Try it out.
