<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%209:23-26&amp;version=NIV">Luke 9:23-26</a><p /> <sup class="versenum">23</sup>Then he said to them all: &quot;If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. <sup class="versenum">24</sup>For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it. <sup class="versenum">25</sup>What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit his very self? <sup class="versenum">26</sup>If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.<p />I was reading some this morning and came across these verses.  Verse 26 kind of hit me in the face.  How many of us supposed christians default to a very pc world view when confronted with God outside of our God comfort zone?  I know I don&#39;t want anyone to think I am ashamed of Christ or the Gospel in any way shape or form.  <p /> <br /><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%209:62&amp;version=NIV">Luke 9:62</a> <p> </p><p> <sup class="versenum">62</sup>Jesus replied, &quot;No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.&quot;</p> Keep looking forward, God will do the rest.  God doesn&#39;t care how much you know about the bible, or how learned you are, or what sins you have committed.  He just wants you to follow him.  So when someone confronts you about christianity.  Tell them you follow the Christ and don&#39;t look back.  God will do the rest.  <p /> <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010:21-22&amp;version=NIV">Luke 10:21-22</a><br /><p> <sup class="versenum">21</sup>At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, &quot;I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure. </p><p> <sup class="versenum">22</sup>&quot;All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.&quot;</p>
