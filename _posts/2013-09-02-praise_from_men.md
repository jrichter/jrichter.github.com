Have you ever ducked a question about Jesus because you were concerned with what the people around you thought?  You don't want to come across as crazy right? I know I have. Well, I was reading John 12 today and came across this.

> For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere:
> “He has blinded their eyes
> and hardened their hearts,
> so they can neither see with their eyes,
> nor understand with their hearts,
> nor turn—and I would heal them.”
> Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about him.
> Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not openly acknowledge their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue; for they loved human praise more than praise from God.

Ouch! Don't love praise from men more than praise from God. Speak **boldly** about Jesus and do not be ashamed! Because,

> Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
