I read this today. Thought it was insightful, so I'm sharing. :)

> Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling
> block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, but to those whom God has called, both Jews and
> Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. For the foolishness of God is wiser
> than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength. Brothers and
> sisters, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human
> standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth. But God chose the
> foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to
> shame the strong. God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things—and the
> things that are not—to nullify the things that are, so that no one may boast before him.
> It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from
> God—that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption. Therefore, as it is written: "Let
> the one who boasts boast in the Lord."
