<p>My wife and I watched Dark of the Moon last night. &nbsp;What a waste. &nbsp;The first five minutes before the Transformers logo was plot important, then most of what happens after they get to Chicago. &nbsp;The whole middle of the movie could have been condensed to five or ten minutes. &nbsp;I am really glad we Redboxed that bad boy. &nbsp;Lots of robot killing action though. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And really, "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few." &nbsp;Come on. &nbsp;Then finally, "There can be only one!" &nbsp;I know we aren't watching Highlander (but that was a great movie).</p>
