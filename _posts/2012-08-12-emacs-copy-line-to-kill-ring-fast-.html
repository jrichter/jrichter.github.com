title: EMACS copy line to kill-ring fast!
published: true
---
<p>Today I added some cool new tricks to my emacs config. &nbsp;I was getting tired of copying lines with the traditional C-a C-SPC C-e M-w. &nbsp;That's lots of key strokes! &nbsp;So I found quick-copy-line down there. &nbsp;It allows me to push the current line to the kill-ring and keep going appending each additional line as I go. &nbsp;What if I want to skip a line? &nbsp;I added quick-add-line for that. &nbsp;If you use quick-copy-line, then switch you have to keep using quick-add-line.</p>
<p>The other cool thing I found was that indent-region after yank advice down there. &nbsp;Now thats neat!</p>
