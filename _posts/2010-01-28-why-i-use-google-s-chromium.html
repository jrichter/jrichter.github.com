title: Why I use Google's Chromium
published: true
---
<div>I like new things, so when Google released Chromium in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome">September of 2008</a>, I was excited. &nbsp;I wanted to try it out, so I did. &nbsp;Now, I am a Windows user who wants to be a Mac user but doesn't have the cash. &nbsp;Not really, I just want the visual candy of the Mac on my linux box and its getting there. &nbsp;Anyways, I don't like Windows. &nbsp;I haven't for some time now. &nbsp;So I use <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu Linux</a>. &nbsp;The linux version of Chromium did not come out for some time, at least a stable release, until June of 2009. &nbsp;I tried Chromium several times over its short lifetime. &nbsp;I kept going back to Firefox though, for the extensions. &nbsp;Then one day I found out that Chromium has extensions! &nbsp;Yay! &nbsp;This put me over the top. &nbsp;Here is my short list of why I like Chromium.</div>
<p />
<div>1. It is fast! &nbsp;</div>

<p />
<div>2. It is sleek. &nbsp;The tabs are at the top. &nbsp;The address bar and other buttons are just beneath the tabs, then the web page. &nbsp;Links and other info pops up from the bottom when you hover over them. &nbsp;Downloads don't appear in a seperate window, but at the bottom. &nbsp;The chrome in Chromium is simple and appealing. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>3. Each tab is a seperate <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/process-models">process</a>. &nbsp;Meaning one tab can't crash the others. &nbsp;<a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/process-models">http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/process-models</a></div>
<p />
<div>4. The tab width stays the same when closing tabs. &nbsp;This allows you to close those 16 million tabs without hunting for the x button. &nbsp;<a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2009/01/tabbed-browsing-in-google-chrome.html">http://blog.chromium.org/2009/01/tabbed-browsing-in-google-chrome.html</a></div>
<p />
<div>5. It has cool <a href="http://www.chromium.org/devtools">developer tools</a>. &nbsp;I didn't even have to install firebug. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.chromium.org/devtools">http://www.chromium.org/devtools</a></div>
<p />
<div>6. It has lots of useful <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions">extensions</a>, albeit not as many as Firefox. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions">https://chrome.google.com/extensions</a></div>
