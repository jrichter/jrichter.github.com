<p>I was wanting to jump to a css class in an html file today and could not find an easy way to do it. I tried using TAGS, but that failed. I spent countless hours searching the internets to no avail. I even asked in the #emacs channel on freenode, but that didn't help. This is what I came up with.</p>
