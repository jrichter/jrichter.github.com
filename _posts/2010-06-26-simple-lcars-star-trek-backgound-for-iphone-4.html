<p>I found a link, <a href="http://www.robotthoughts.com/technology/2007/12/icars-a-star-trek-lcars-summerboard-theme-for-the-itouch-and-iphone/">http://www.robotthoughts.com/technology/2007/12/icars-a-star-trek-lcars-summerboard-theme-for-the-itouch-and-iphone/</a> that had a cool theme for a jail broken iPhone.  I didn't want to jail break my phone, so I created some simple backgrounds that were inspired from the above link.</p>
