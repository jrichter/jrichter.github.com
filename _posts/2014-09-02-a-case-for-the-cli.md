# A Case for the CLI
Today I was reading [The Mythical Man Finger](http://stephenramsay.us/2011/07/25/the-mythical-man-finger/) and I just love this quote,

> the idea that language is for power users and pictures and index fingers
> are for those poor besotted fools who just want toast in the morning is
> an extremely retrograde idea from which we should strive to emancipate
> ourselves.

Stephen Ramsay makes a good point, we should not forget the power of language.
Programming, scripting, whatever you want to call it, everyone can do it.
Some are better than others, but we can all do it. And we should.
