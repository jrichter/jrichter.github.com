# Justin Richter's Blog

My blog converted to a static site using [Jekyll][j].

## About

In the words of [mojombo][]:

> I was tired of having my blog posts end up in a database off on some remote server. That is backwards. I've lost valuable posts that way. I want to author my posts locally in Textile or Markdown. My blog should be easily stylable and customizable any way I please. It should take care of creating a feed for me. And most of all, my site should be stored on GitHub so that I never lose data again.
